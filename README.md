# Age Verification System

This project is a **simple, interactive age verification web application** developed using **HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript**. It allows users to input their name and age to determine whether they are considered a legal adult (18 years or older) or a minor.

This is an ideal beginner-friendly project to practice basic **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **responsive design** with clean and modern styling.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to simulate a basic real-world authentication/validation scenario using client-side logic. When users enter their name and age, the system will provide personalized feedback based on whether they are above or below 18 years old. This kind of functionality is commonly found in many online forms, websites with age restrictions, and educational platforms.
